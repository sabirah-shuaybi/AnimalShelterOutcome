# AnimalShelterOutcome

# Abstract
According to the pet statistics in the US, every year, approximately 7.6 millions animals end up in the shelters. They are mostly abandoned by the owners or rescued out of cruelty situations. It is unfortunate that not all animals which are treated cruelly are rescued. That is why animal advocates are working hard to raise awareness and to reduce the number of cases of animal abuse. Since we care about improving the lives of animals, we also want to contribute something to make sure all animals have a home. As for our motivation for this project, we chose this data set on animal outcomes because we want to look for the trend in the outcomes of animals that end up in shelters and therefore, predict the outcome of an animal given their attributes: color, breed, sex, and age. This will help shelters focus their energy on certain kinds of animal that need more help to find a new home.
